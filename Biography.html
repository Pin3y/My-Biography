<h3 class="text">My favorite song</h3>

<p class="text">This song is called Superstar by Lupe Fiasco Featuring Matthew Santos off of Lupe Fiasco's The Cool which is also one of my favorite albums and is also the background of this website.The song gives off a sense of Aspiration and Luxury,For me the song is telling you that you can do whatever you do as long as you really aspire to do it,hense the lyrics "If you are what you say you are,a Superstar,Then have no fear the camera's here" and Lupe's rapping is just amazing the depth to his lyrics is incredible </p>
